# IECgas

The building that housed my laboratory during my PhD work has a number of 
hazardous gases in regular use, so there are sampling points throughout the 
facility to detect these gases in case one is accidentally released. The 
detectors use 1980s technology, but with some kludging, they can communicate 
their reports to a computer running a web server.

This project parses that noisy, often corrupt data to show a clean record of
what's going on during an alarm, so that it's accessible to laboratory
staff on mobile phones and easily communicated to emergency responders.
